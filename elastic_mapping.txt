title: Represents the title of the knowledge base entry. It's of type text for full-text search, and an additional keyword field is included for exact match searches. I will use standard analyzer thanks to its general-purpose use in text fields. It tokenizes text into words, removes most punctuation, and lowercases the words.

content: Represents the content or details of the knowledge base entry. It's of type text for full-text search. Same analyzer as for title.

tags: Represents tags associated with the entry. It's of type keyword for efficient filtering.

timestamp: Represents the timestamp of when the entry was created or last modified. It's of type date for date-related queries.
