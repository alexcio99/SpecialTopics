Personal Knowledge Base

In today's digital age, the volume of information available to individuals is immense. From work-related documents to personal notes, the challenge lies not in acquiring knowledge but in effectively organizing and retrieving it. This is where the concept of a Personal Knowledge Base (PKB) project comes into play, offering a powerful solution for knowledge management. When combined with the scalability and flexibility of Elastic Cloud, PKBs become even more robust and versatile.

# Defining the Personal Knowledge Base (PKB)
A Personal Knowledge Base is a central repository for individuals to store, organize, and access their knowledge resources. It's a dynamic system designed to help users manage various forms of information, such as documents, notes, bookmarks, and more. What sets a PKB apart is its ability to adapt to the user's unique needs, allowing them to structure knowledge based on their preferences and requirements.

# Technologies to be used:
- Front-End Framework: React - a modern front-end framework
- Back-End Framework: Node.js to build the server-side logic of our PKB application
- Database: Elastic Cloud itself is excellent for text indexing and search
