Personal Knowledge Base

In today's digital age, the volume of information available to individuals is immense. From work-related documents to personal notes, the challenge lies not in acquiring knowledge but in effectively organizing and retrieving it. This is where the concept of a Personal Knowledge Base (PKB) project comes into play, offering a powerful solution for knowledge management. When combined with the scalability and flexibility of Elastic Cloud, PKBs become even more robust and versatile.

# Defining the Personal Knowledge Base (PKB)
A Personal Knowledge Base is a central repository for individuals to store, organize, and access their knowledge resources. It's a dynamic system designed to help users manage various forms of information, such as documents, notes, bookmarks, and more. What sets a PKB apart is its ability to adapt to the user's unique needs, allowing them to structure knowledge based on their preferences and requirements.

# Technologies to be used:
- Front-End Framework: Flask - a modern front-end framework
- Back-End: Python to build the server-side logic of our PKB application
- Database: Elastic Cloud itself is excellent for text indexing and searching

# REST API Structure
- GET /notes: Get a list notes.
- GET /notes/{note_id}: Get details of a specific note.
- POST /notes: Create a new note.
- PUT /notes/{note_id}: Update a note.
- DELETE /notes/{note_id}: Delete a note.
- GET /notes/_search: Search for notes based on keywords and filters.
